      The <a href="http://allmalepanels.tumblr.com/" target="blank">"manel" </a>(= all male panel) is a prevalent occurence within the field of ancient history. 
      In order to combat this, <a href="http://www.lib.uiowa.edu/bam/" target="_blank">BAM</a> set up a crowd-sourced .csv file so that a list of women in the field could be 
      compiled and subsequently kept updated through the years. This list has no one author, but is rather a product of 
      over 100+ women and men who took the time to contribute. The map, network analysis, and interface was then built 
      by Ryan Horne, lead developer at BAM. We hope that you use it to reach out to a female ancient historian in order 
      to write a review, to be on a panel, to write an article, or just to read her work.
